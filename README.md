I'm a Web Designer / Developer with a knack for solving problems and an unending passion for making things work. Now based in London, I've spent the last few years working on a wide range of projects and expanding my skill set. I've been contracting throughout 2014, working a couple of months for each client, but am now looking for a more permanent position in 2015.

Web development
---------------

I'm passionate about great design and usability, but I'm even more passionate about seeing the two combined to create outstanding tools and products.

After studying Graphic Design at university, I gravitated towards Web Design as an opportunity to explore new technologies, then I recently devoted three months to learning how to code at [Makers Academy]. I grasp new ideas quickly and would like to broaden my skills primarily as a front-end web developer.
